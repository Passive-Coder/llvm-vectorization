# Rust Loop Vectorizer for LLVM 21

A correctness-first automatic loop-vectorization pass whose discovery,
dependence analysis, profitability model, and LLVM IR generation are written in
Rust. A small C++ adapter only registers the pass with LLVM's New Pass Manager
and bridges APIs that LLVM does not expose through C.

The project implements the requested end-to-end path:

- detects canonical count-up loops;
- proves a deliberately bounded legality contract;
- performs affine same-base dependence and conservative alias analysis;
- selects a fixed vector factor with conservative, balanced, or aggressive
  profitability policies;
- emits real fixed-width LLVM vector loads, stores, arithmetic, casts,
  comparisons, and selects;
- retains the scalar loop for short inputs and exact scalar remainders;
- reports vector coverage, issued-lane utilization, rejection reasons, and
  per-loop analysis/transformation latency; and
- compares identical scalar input IR against LLVM's built-in Loop Vectorizer
  with native correctness and timing harnesses.

This is a research and teaching implementation for compiler optimization,
code generation, and parallelism modules. It intentionally rejects IR it
cannot prove safe; it is not presented as a replacement for LLVM's production
vectorizer.

## Measured result

On the checked-in 128-loop compile-time corpus, a release build measured
**2.355 µs p50**, **8.790 µs p95**, and **31.404 µs p99** for the custom pass's
combined in-process analysis and transformation. The run used LLVM 21.1.3 on
an Apple M5 and transformed 128/128 loops.

In the seven-kernel runtime comparison, all scalar/custom/LLVM variants passed
correctness. The recorded geometric-mean speedups over the scalar control were
**3.009× for this pass** and **2.974× for LLVM LoopVectorize**. These are
cache-hot results from one machine, not universal performance claims. See the
[machine-readable snapshot](docs/benchmark-results.json) and
[research report](docs/research-report.md#53-local-controlled-result) for the
protocol, per-kernel results, and caveats.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.85 or newer
- LLVM 21.x, including `llvm-config`, `opt`, `clang`, `llc`, and `llvm-dis`
- a C++17 compiler compatible with the installed LLVM build
- Python 3.10 or newer for the benchmark driver
- macOS or Linux for the native test/benchmark scripts

For Homebrew LLVM:

```sh
export LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix llvm)"
export PATH="$LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
```

On other systems, set `LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX` to the LLVM 21 installation prefix
and put that installation's `bin` directory on `PATH`. `LLVM_CONFIG_PATH` may
additionally select the exact `llvm-config` used by this project's C++ bridge,
but the `llvm-sys` dependency itself discovers LLVM through
`LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX` or `PATH`. Build the plugin and load it with tools from
the same LLVM installation; LLVM's C++ pass-plugin ABI is not a cross-install
compatibility boundary.

## Build and run

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### CLI application

The release build includes `rv-vectorize`, a command-line application that
discovers LLVM 21 and the pass plugin, constructs the pass pipeline, and
propagates LLVM verifier failures:

```sh
target/release/rv-vectorize --report input.ll -o output.ll
```

It accepts textual LLVM IR (`.ll`) or bitcode (`.bc`). The default policy is
`balanced`, the vector factor is selected automatically, textual IR is written
to stdout when `-o` is omitted, and LLVM verification is enabled. Common
variants are:

```sh
# Favor compile time and require stronger estimated profitability.
target/release/rv-vectorize --policy conservative input.ll -o output.ll

# Force eight lanes after the normal legality checks.
target/release/rv-vectorize --vf 8 --report input.bc -o output.ll

# Emit bitcode and show the fully resolved LLVM command.
target/release/rv-vectorize --emit-bitcode input.ll -o output.bc
target/release/rv-vectorize --dry-run input.ll -o output.ll
```

Run `rv-vectorize --help` for all options. Use `--llvm-prefix`, `--opt`, and
`--plugin` for explicit toolchain selection; the corresponding environment
variables are `LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX`, `LLVM_CONFIG_PATH`, and
`RV_PLUGIN_PATH`. Fixed `--vf` values bypass profitability but never bypass
dependence or legality checks.

### Interactive TUI application

The project also includes a full-screen terminal application:

```sh
make tui
# or, after cargo build --release:
target/release/rv-vectorize-tui
```

The TUI starts with the positive fixture and `build/tui-vectorized.ll` as its
default input and output. It provides editable paths, policy and vector-width
selectors, diagnostics/verification/bitcode toggles, and an on-screen results
pane containing the vectorizer's per-loop decisions.

Keyboard controls:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab`, `↑`, `↓` | Move between controls. |
| `←`, `→` | Move within text or change a selector. |
| `Enter`, `Space` | Toggle a setting or activate the Run button. |
| `Ctrl-R` | Run from anywhere in the application. |
| Mouse wheel | Scroll the session pane. |
| `PageUp`, `PageDown` | Scroll the session pane by five rows. |
| `Ctrl-↑`, `Ctrl-↓` | Scroll the session pane one row. |
| `Home`, `End` | Jump to the oldest or newest output, unless a path field is focused. |
| `Esc`, `Ctrl-C` | Exit and restore the terminal. |

The session pane follows the newest output until you scroll up, shows a
scrollbar whenever the transcript overflows, and resumes following once you
scroll back to the bottom. Mouse reporting is enabled while the application
runs, so hold `Shift` to use the terminal's own text selection.

### Direct LLVM invocation

On macOS:

```sh
/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/opt \
  -load-pass-plugin=target/release/librust_loop_vectorizer.dylib \
  -passes='rust-loop-vectorize-report,verify' \
  -S input.ll -o output.ll
```

On Linux, use `librust_loop_vectorizer.so` and the path to the LLVM 21 `opt`.
Report mode emits one parseable line per discovered candidate, for example:

```text
rv-vectorize: function=add_f32 loop=loop decision=vectorized reason=legal-and-profitable vf=4 estimated_vector_coverage=100% issued_lane_utilization=100% analysis_us=2.834 transform_us=10.708
```

To create suitable scalar IR from C before applying the pass:

```sh
clang -O1 -fno-vectorize -fno-slp-vectorize -fno-unroll-loops \
  -ffp-contract=off -emit-llvm -S kernel.c -o kernel.ll
```

## Policies and pass names

| Pass | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `rust-loop-vectorize` | Balanced policy; automatic power-of-two VF within a 128-bit baseline. |
| `rust-loop-vectorize-report` | Balanced policy with diagnostics and internal timings. |
| `rust-loop-vectorize-conservative` | Requires at least `4*VF` estimated iterations and 1.25× estimated gain. |
| `rust-loop-vectorize-aggressive` | Requires at least `VF` iterations and break-even estimated cost. |
| `rust-loop-vectorize-force-vf2` | Forces VF 2 after all legality checks. |
| `rust-loop-vectorize-force-vf4` | Forces VF 4 after all legality checks. |
| `rust-loop-vectorize-force-vf8` | Forces VF 8 after all legality checks. |
| `rust-loop-vectorize-force-vf16` | Forces VF 16 after all legality checks. |

Append `-report` to the conservative, aggressive, or forced-VF names for
diagnostics. Forced widths bypass the profitability ratio, never legality.

## Supported loop subset

Accepted loops have:

- one loop block, one exit, and one ordinary branch preheader edge;
- one zero-based `i64` induction PHI with unit positive step;
- `eq`, `ne`, or canonical unsigned-`lt` latch comparison against an invariant
  trip count;
- no loop value used outside the loop and no exit PHI;
- direct argument/global bases and one-index `i + constant` GEPs;
- nonvolatile, nonatomic contiguous memory operations using `i8/i16/i32/i64`,
  `half`, `float`, or `double` elements;
- distinct globals, pairs of `noalias` arguments, or proven safe same-base
  dependence distances; and
- a target layout with packed scalar/vector storage and exactly 64-bit GEP
  index arithmetic in the relevant address space. A missing module data layout
  is rejected because generic defaults are not a target contract.

The pass supports lane-wise arithmetic, division/remainder, shifts, bitwise
operations, casts, comparisons, `select`, floating negation, loads, and stores.
It preserves applicable fast-math, integer nowrap, exact, GEP inbounds, and
memory-alignment properties.

Not yet supported: runtime alias versioning, reductions, calls/intrinsics,
multi-block control flow and if-conversion, nonunit/descending induction,
masked tails, scalable vectors, interleaving, outer-loop vectorization, or
TargetTransformInfo-based costing. Each becomes a safe future extension only
with its corresponding legality proof and tests.

## Verification

Run the complete suite:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

It currently covers 43 Rust tests, the CLI and TUI applications, nine positive
LLVM loops plus a fourteen-loop breadth showcase spanning VF 2/4/8/16 and every
supported element type, twenty-nine conservative rejection fixtures covering
distinct named reasons, a byte-for-byte check that a fully rejected module is
left unmodified, policy selection, forced VF, LLVM's verifier, native
differential execution over boundary trip counts, all three supported latch
forms, memory-order cases, and guard-page detection of tail over-read/write.

Run the generated differential corpus in quick mode:

```sh
make differential
# differential-test: ok mode=quick ... cases=32 pass-configs=7 \
#   runtime-configs=2 executions=8192 unsupported-probes=9
```

`make differential-full` expands this to 397,824 byte-for-byte scalar/vector
comparisons across natural and forced VFs, `-O0`/`-O2`, boundary and randomized
trip counts, and a UBSan run. Both modes verify every generated module and
confirm that all nine unsupported-shape probes remain scalar. Reproducible
artifacts are written only to `build/differential/`.

Run the reproducible comparison:

```sh
./scripts/benchmark.py --warmups 3 --samples 21 \
  --inner-calls 64 --timing-runs 15
```

The script compiles the kernel source to scalar bitcode once with both LLVM
vectorizers disabled. Scalar, custom, and LLVM variants then fork from that
byte-identical bitcode and use the same backend/link flags. It verifies every
variant, tests edge lengths, records repeated runtime samples, times 128 cloned
loops, and writes full JSON/CSV artifacts to `build/benchmark/`.

Useful development commands:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
make test
```
